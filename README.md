# Uma Musume Meta & Master.MDB Repo [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/omj5yfx2yrrjv2c9?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/SimpleSandman/umamusumemetamastermdb)

This repo holds the `meta` and `master.mdb` files for the mobile game, [Uma Musume: Pretty Derby](https://umamusume.jp/).

## IMPORTANT: Retiring this repo October 29th!
So I'll be shutting down this project very soon. I've already worked with Katboi from UmaViewer so that app isn't affected by this. My reasoning is that I've been meaning to move on from project as far as maintenance goes. As I've haven't played this game for 3+ years now, but I've always enjoyed this community and wanted to provide some kind of support for as long as I can. I've open-sourced everything except for the CI/CD (which is a very simple setup). This is in the event anyone wanted to pick up where I've left off.

Just for the sake of anyone not following closely to this thread, I'm going to set the EOL (end of life) for the API and supporting apps around Oct 29th (in the United States) for Heroku billing cycle reasons.

## Archived master.mdb repo
Older copies of the `master.mdb` is at the archived repo [here](https://github.com/SimpleSandman/UmaMusumeMasterMDB).
